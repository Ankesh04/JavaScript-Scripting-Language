/*
*********HOW CODE IS EXECUTED IN JAVASCRIPT**********

JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT
Whatever js file yo have made how it will be executed
what js does is that it runs in two phase

{}--> this our code 
so in this Gobal execution context will be made and if the gec is made it will be refered to variable "this" 

interviewer ask if you run js code in browser then browser's gec is different and nodejs environment is different so what we call browser's gec this value ?
for browser gec this value we call it "window object"

javascript is single threaded iske andar har ek chiz process hoti hai

There are different excecution context:
-GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
-FUNCTION/FUNCTIONAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
-EVAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
